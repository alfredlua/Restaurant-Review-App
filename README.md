A responsive restaurant review app that works offline

## How to use the app

1. Clone the repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/alfredlua/restaurant-review-app` in your terminal.
2. Change directory into the folder and run the server locally.
	* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
   * These instructions were taken from [Udacity's repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
